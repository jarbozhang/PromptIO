Block Diffusion Language Models (BD-LMs) improve diffusion-based text generation with KV caching and flexible-length generation. A natural next step is to extend them from Single-Block Diffusion (SingleBD) to Multi-Block Diffusion (MultiBD), where a running-set of consecutive blocks is decoded concurrently for inter-block parallelism. However, existing BD-LMs are mostly trained under teacher forcing, where the model observes only one noisy block conditioned on a clean prefix. While the recent diffusion forcing strategy introduces visibility among multiple noisy blocks, its training states still differ from MultiBD inference, where decoding operates on a bounded running-set with heterogeneous slot-wise noise patterns. To bridge this gap, we propose Multi-Block Diffusion Language Models (MBD-LMs), obtained by post-training BD-LMs with Multi-block Teacher Forcing (MultiTF). MultiTF integrates teacher forcing and diffusion forcing by training on bounded noise-groups conditioned on clean prefixes, with randomized noise-schedulers that better match MultiBD inference states. To make MultiBD practically executable, we further introduce an optimized decoding algorithm based on the Block Buffer mechanism that preserves prefix-cache reuse, keeps input shapes static, and translates increased decoding parallelism into wall-clock acceleration. Empirically, MBD-LLaDA2-Mini increases average Tokens Per Forward pass (TPF) from 3.47 to 6.19 and improves average accuracy from 79.95% to 81.03%; when combined with DMax, MBD-LLaDA2-Mini-DMax reaches an average TPF of 9.34 with only a 1.02% accuracy drop on math and code benchmarks.
