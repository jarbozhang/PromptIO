The efficiency of a datacenter rests on its control plane policies. Designing these policies is increasingly hard: the hardware-software stack grows fast, the design space is vast and interdependent, and prototyping a single policy takes months. Agentic AI promises to automate this search. Off the shelf, however, it falls short on three fronts. It is not formal: with no structured, searchable statement of the problem, the search has little structure to exploit and hard constraints are not guaranteed. It is not transferable: each task is solved from scratch, so nothing learned on one task carries to the next. Finally, it is not systematic: relying on the LLM as the sole source of candidates, it explores a narrow slice of the design space and settles into local optima. We introduce AtumAI, a framework that generates datacenter control-plane policies with agentic AI, making the process formal, transferable, and systematic. From a goal stated in plain language, AtumAI autonomously proposes, tests, and refines candidate policies until one satisfies the request. It does so through two components. The Datacenter Task Compiler automates problem formulation: it compiles the request into a formal, machine-checkable, and searchable specification of the task's objectives, constraints, decision variables, and evaluation methodology. The Evolutionary Design Discovery Loop then searches this specification, expanding the search beyond the LLM itself via a diffusion model, an evolutionary alg
