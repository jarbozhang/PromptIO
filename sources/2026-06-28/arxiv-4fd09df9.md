Neural surrogate models offer fast approximate mappings from PDE parameters to solutions, but they typically treat solving as a purely statistical task: once trained, they struggle to correct their own constraint violations and extrapolate beyond the training distribution. Recent hybrid methods promote physical correctness by targeting the PDE residual via gradient descent or Gauss--Newton steps, but inherit the compute cost and instability of the underlying classical optimizers. We show, theoretically and empirically, that numerically minimizing the PDE residual can be an unreliable proxy for reconstruction accuracy in ill-conditioned systems, explaining why these methods often do not make accurate predictions despite achieving low residuals. We propose error-conditioned Neural Solvers (ENS), built on a different principle: rather than an optimization target, the PDE residual field is passed as a direct input to the network at each iteration, enabling it to read the spatial structure of its own errors and learn an update policy to iteratively correct its predictions. Across four PDE families, ENS attains the highest prediction accuracy in the large majority of settings, with gains reaching $10\times$ on turbulent Kolmogorov flow, while avoiding the expensive compute cost of hybrid methods. ENS's learned correction policy generalizes under distribution shift, including zero-shot parameter changes and cross-equation transfer, where its relative advantage is largest in the ill-
