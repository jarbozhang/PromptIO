Science currently offers two options for quality assurance, both inadequate. Journal gatekeeping claims to verify both integrity and contribution, but actually measures prestige: peer review is slow, biased, and misses fabricated citations even at top venues. Open science provides no quality assurance at all: the only filter between AI-generated text and the public record is the author's integrity. AI-assisted writing makes both worse by producing more papers faster than either system can absorb. We propose a third option: measure the paper itself. sciwrite-lint (pip install sciwrite-lint) is an open-source linter for scientific manuscripts that runs entirely on the researcher's machine (free public databases, a single consumer GPU, and open-weights models) with no manuscripts sent to external services. The pipeline verifies that references exist, checks retraction status, compares metadata against canonical records, downloads and parses cited papers, verifies that they support the claims made about them, and follows one level further to check cited papers' own bibliographies. Each reference receives a per-reference reliability score aggregating all verification signals. We evaluate the pipeline on 30 unseen papers from arXiv and bioRxiv with error injection and LLM-adjudicated false positive analysis. As an experimental extension, we propose SciLint Score, combining integrity verification with a contribution component that operationalizes five frameworks from philosophy of s
