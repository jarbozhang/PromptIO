In the era of autonomous agents, machine-actionable data is critical for data-driven workflows. For more than a decade, semantic metadata like schema.org has anchored the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) for machine-actionable data and enabled discovery tools like Google Dataset Search. However, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of navigating the unstructured web raises a fundamental question: Is semantic metadata still necessary for agentic data discovery, or can agents reliably retrieve actionable data directly from the web? We present a comparative analysis of agentic data retrieval across two distinct environments: a Baseline Agent searching billions of open-web documents, and a Semantic Agent leveraging a corpus of 90 million datasets using schema.org. We deploy an "LLM-as-a-judge" evaluation pipeline, mapped directly to the FAIR principles, to assess the semantic relevance, data accessibility, and computational utility of the retrieved data. Our results reveal a clear divergence. The Semantic Agent excels at retrieving actionable data, achieving a 44.9% higher precision for metadata-rich registries and a 46.6% higher precision for pages with machine-readable downloads among its returned results. Conversely, the Baseline Agent frequently suffers "Last-Mile Utility" failures, retrieving prose-heavy pages (20.1% of results) and portal landing pages (8.5%) rather than actual data pages. While the Baseline Agent achieves high
