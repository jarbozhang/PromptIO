While Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG) has shown promising results, it still struggles with complex multi-hop reasoning tasks. Existing methods primarily focus on independent instance-level matching, which often fails to capture explicit relationships across modalities and documents. Although Graph-enhanced methods introduce structural modeling, they face a fundamental challenge in multimodal scenarios: incorporating fine-grained visual features leads to rapid graph expansion and retrieval noise, whereas coarse-grained representations cause the discarding of critical local evidence. To address this dilemma, we propose DualG-MRAG, a Dual-tier framework that introduces a decoupled architecture comprising Macro-reasoning and Micro-matching Graphs for Multimodal RAG. Specifically, to suppress retrieval noise by isolating global structural reasoning from fine-grained evidence matching, we construct a Macro Graph for global topological routing and a Micro Graph for precise local verification. Subsequently, to enable dynamic relevance propagation across heterogeneous evidence sources, we formulate retrieval as a query-driven message passing process via a GNN Retriever. Furthermore, to provide the generative model with coherent structural guidance, we introduce a dynamic programming decoding mechanism that extracts explicit reasoning paths directly from the GNN's forward pass, replacing the standard input of isolated document chunks.
