Autonomous AI agents can execute complex tasks with limited human review, yet they often lack the grounded operational knowledge to make their outputs not just executable but correct, secure, and maintainable. We introduce SkillCenter, to our knowledge the largest open skill library for agents by total count: 216,938 structured skills across 24 domain bundles. A SkillGate-filtered pipeline contributes 114,565 source-grounded skills from peer-reviewed journals, ArXiv, and over 24,000 technical sources, integrated with 102,373 community skills from GitHub and the ClawHub marketplace. We present the end-to-end framework that builds the pipeline subset: multi-source acquisition, an LLM-based quality gate (SkillGate), template-driven generation, iterative source-grounding, and quality-controlled publishing. Source grounding is a traceability guarantee: each retained claim maps to an exact quotation in its source. All skills ship as offline-searchable SQLite FTS5 bundles.
