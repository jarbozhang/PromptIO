Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) stalls on a model's hardest problems: when no rollout in a group succeeds, the group-relative advantages vanish and the problem contributes no gradient, wasting the frontier examples we most want to learn from. Prepending a correct prefix of a reference solution raises the success rate, making prefix length a continuous knob on difficulty. Concurrent methods set the knob once; AdaPrefix-GRPO turns it into a feedback controller: throughout training it adjusts how much of the solution each problem gets, holding its success rate near 50%, where GRPO's gradient signal is largest, then withdraws the assistance entirely, so the deployed model solves problems unaided. On hard math, at matched training FLOPs, it more than doubles GRPO's accuracy on held-out problems from the training distribution for a 0.6B model (2.1x), with 1.6x on Qwen3-1.7B and 1.7x on AIME, while roughly halving trace length. The method is implemented in data preparation plus a loss mask on prefix tokens; the trainer is otherwise stock. The smaller the model, the larger the gain.
