Free energies govern solid-state phase stability, yet computational materials discovery still relies largely on ground-state energies because free energy calculations require ensemble averages. We introduce the thermodynamic interatomic potential (TIP), which extends an interatomic potential from its static energy to a thermodynamically consistent Gibbs free energy model, with thermodynamic responses following from temperature and pressure by automatic differentiation. We implement TIP[UMA] using the universal potential UMA, train it on free energies from quasi-harmonic to molecular dynamics fidelity, and calibrate it to higher-resolution calculations or experiment. From a single evaluation, it returns the equation of state of a crystal and locates phase transitions among competing branches, including dynamically stabilized phases. Fine-tuning extends the model to alloy solubility limits and miscibility gaps. TIP makes the free energy as accessible as the potential energy, opening finite-temperature phase stability to high-throughput discovery.
