Test-Time Training (TTT) enables long-context processing via continuous weight updates during inference, but current methods struggle to balance the expressivity of per-token update dynamics with the hardware efficiency of chunk-wise approximations. We propose E$^2$-TTT (Expressive and Efficient TTT) to bridge this gap. Under the standard approximation of taking gradients at the chunk-start weights, we derive a closed-form state transition that exactly reproduces the chunk-end fast-weight and momentum states of the per-token recurrence. This enables fully parallelized chunk-level training while preserving the temporal structure of the update rule that prior chunk-wise methods discard. We validate E$^2$-TTT by training models up to 1.3B parameters from scratch. It performs on par with previous TTT and hybrid attention baselines in language modeling while outperforming them on in-context retrieval. Its advantage is most pronounced in length extrapolation: on the standard ``Needle in a Haystack'' passkey test, it retains over 90% accuracy at $8\times$ the training context length. Meanwhile, E$^2$-TTT can match the training throughput of efficient chunk-wise methods, demonstrating that it effectively reconciles expressivity with efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/zeyun-zhong/E2-TTT.
