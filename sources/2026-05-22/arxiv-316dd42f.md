Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks have largely emphasized perception-based tasks that can be solved from visual content alone. In contrast, many real-world scenarios require external knowledge that is not directly observable in the image to answer correctly. We introduce WikiVQABench, a human-curated knowledge-grounded VQA benchmark constructed by systematically combining Wikipedia images, their associated article captions, and structured knowledge from Wikidata. Our pipeline uses large language models (LLMs) to generate candidate multiple-choice image-question-answer sets. All generated instances are subsequently reviewed and curated by human annotators to ensure factual correctness, visual-text consistency, and that each question requires external knowledge in addition to visual evidence for correct resolution. WikiVQABench comprises a substantial collection of Wikipedia images with curated multiple-choice questions designed to benchmark knowledge-aware vision-language models (VLMs). Evaluation of fifteen VLMs (256M-90B parameters) reveals a wide performance range (24.7%-75.6% accuracy), demonstrating that the benchmark effectively discriminates model capabilities on knowledge-intensive reasoning. The dataset and benchmarking code are publicly available.
