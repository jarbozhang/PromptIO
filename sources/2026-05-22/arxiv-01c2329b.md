We present Mem-$π$, a framework for adaptive memory in large language model (LLM) agents, where useful guidance is generated on demand rather than retrieved from external memory stores. Existing memory-augmented agents typically rely on similarity-based retrieval from episodic memory banks or skill libraries, returning static entries that often misalign with the current context. In contrast, Mem-$π$ uses a dedicated language or vision-language model with its own parameters, separate from the downstream agent, to generate context-specific guidance for complex tasks. Conditioned on the current agent context, the model jointly decides when to produce guidance and what guidance to produce. We train it with a decision-content decoupled reinforcement learning (RL) objective, enabling it to abstain when generation would not help and otherwise produce concise, useful guidance. Across diverse agentic benchmarks spanning web navigation, terminal-based tool use, and text-based embodied interaction, Mem-$π$ consistently outperforms retrieval-based and prior RL-optimized memory baselines, achieving over 30% relative improvement on web navigation tasks.
