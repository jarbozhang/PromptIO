Modern large language models - transformers and diffusion language models - are built around two canonical algorithmic tasks: prediction and generation. We prove unconditional separations between low-depth quantum computation and the corresponding bounded-resource classical language-model architectures in both regimes. Concretely, we exhibit the following: 1. Distributional separation. We give a distribution that is sampleable by $\textsf{QNC}^0$ circuits (i.e., a family of constant-depth quantum circuits consisting of bounded fan-in gates) that no constant-round diffusion language model ($\textsf{DLM}$) with shallow scheduling and denoising can sample within constant distance, even when allowed sublinear chain-of-thought and output-token revision/remasking events, the very features modern $\textsf{DLM}$s rely on. 2. Functional separation. We exhibit a function computable in $\land \circ \textsf{QNC}^0[\log\log n]$ (i.e., a family of O$(\log\log n)$-depth $\textsf{QNC}^0$ circuits, where $n$ is the input length, followed by a single classical $\mathsf{AND}$ gate) such that any constant-depth decoder-only transformer computing the function must be large: it would have to have width $n^{Ω(1)}$. Together, our work initiates the study of quantum advantage in the era of large language models.
