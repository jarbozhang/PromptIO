Full-length song generation must preserve coherence and musicality, render detailed vocal and accompaniment acoustics, and follow lyrics and prompts. Existing language model-based systems face a structural trade-off: mixed-token modeling preserves vocal-instrument coordination but obscures track-specific details, whereas dual-track prediction improves acoustics but requires longer sequences and weakens global planning. We present LeVo 2, a hybrid LLM-Diffusion framework for controllable full-length song generation. LeVo 2 formulates this trade-off as hierarchical modeling: LeLM first predicts mixed tokens for semantic planning, then predicts vocal and accompaniment tokens in parallel for track-specific refinement, while a diffusion-based Music Codec reconstructs full-length waveforms. A central contribution of this extended version is an aesthetics-guided training schedule for alignment. During pre-training, an automated music aesthetic evaluation framework assigns musicality-tier conditions to large-scale data, providing musicality priors before preference alignment. Progressive post-training applies SFT, large-scale offline DPO, and closed-loop semi-online DPO to separately improve generation quality, controllability, and musicality. Modular extension then trains the Track-Specific LM for acoustic refinement while preserving the aligned semantic planner. This schedule separates musicality learning, controllability alignment, and acoustic refinement, mitigating optimization
