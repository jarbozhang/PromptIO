Hello; I'm a semi-beginner at local AI. I've been experimenting with this tech for a while, and I still haven't found a proper harness that fits my models, hardware, and needs.
 My use case is pretty simple: web search, fetching, and browser use. Summarizing websites and having the agent explain stuff to me / Q&A. Potentially some agentic RAG (or whatever RAG-style implementation works best for my specs). Filesystem capabilities and a shell. MCP servers are a must (I use the GitHub, Hugging Face, Reddit, OpenRouter, etc. ones). A sandboxed JS/Python environment would be cool too. PDF reading is highly valuable to me, so that too.
 So far, I've tried the following:
  
A large LM Studio plugins/MCP roster. It works, but it's not ideal.
 Hermes Agent. It injects a ridiculous amount of context and does a bunch of prompt processing and other sci-fi stuff that slows the workflow down way too much.
  
My specs:
 RTX 5050 8 GB VRAM
 16 GB DDR5 RAM
 13th-gen i5 CPU
 My models (best I've found):
  
Ornith 1 9B; Unsloth Q4 quant; Q4 KV cache; 65,536 ctx
 Gemma 4 E4B QAT; Unsloth Q4 quant; Q4 KV cache; 131,072 ctx
 Gemma 4 E2B QAT; Unsloth Q4 quant; Q8 KV cache or full precision; 131,072 ctx
 Ling 3.0 Tiny; using their custom llama.cpp fork; Q8 KV cache; Q4 quant; 131,072 ctx
 InternScience_Agents-A1-4B; Bartowski Q6 quant; Q8 KV cache; 131,072 ctx
  
All running with optimal sampling/settings in LM Studio.
 Do you guys know of a lightweight harness that fills these needs? I want to finally settle this nonstop tinkering I'm doing so I can actually stick with something good and only switch models when better ones come out.
