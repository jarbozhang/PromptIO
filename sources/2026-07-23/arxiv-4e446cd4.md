RGB-D semantic segmentation has achieved remarkable progress, yet most models assume that RGB and depth are always available. In practice, failures or occlusions of surveillance sensors often remove one modality. Although RGB or depth alone can contain sufficient cues, models trained only on full-modality inputs fail to exploit the remaining modality once one is missing, causing severe degradation. We tackle this issue with a simple continued-training paradigm, \emph{Condition Dropout (ConD)}, which mitigates degradation while preserving full-modality accuracy. Starting from a pretrained RGB-D model, ConD adds a second stage that randomly simulates complete, RGB-missing, and depth-missing inputs, freezes the original encoders, and trains copied encoders with zero-initialized feature injection. Experiments on NYU-Depth V2 and SUN RGB-D show that ConD improves robustness under missing modalities and even yields slight gains when modalities are complete. Our code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.
