Conditional Independence (CI) tests are the statistical engine of constraint-based causal discovery: in algorithms such as PC (Peter-Clark) and FCI (Fast Causal Inference), skeleton pruning and key orientations follow directly from CI decisions. This survey reviews CI testing with emphasis on assumptions, robustness, and scalability in high-dimensional and mixed-type settings common in biomedical domains. The survey organizes widely used CI methods into six families: partial-correlation, contingency-table, regression, nearest-neighbor, kernel, and machine-learning-based. Special emphasis is provided on the robustness layers that address the limitations of these families. For each family, the survey examines when CI decisions reflect the data-generating distribution and when they fail. By this, we link test-level properties, including power decay with conditioning set size and asymmetric type I/II error consequences, to graph-level errors in skeleton recovery and v-structure orientation. The survey also compares adoption across major R and Python libraries and summarizes open challenges, including mixed-type CI testing without discretization, small-sample error control, and strategies for improving scalability of CI-testing.
