Logic Tensor Networks (LTN) provide a neurosymbolic framework in which first-order logic is interpreted through tensor operations, enabling logical constraints to be integrated with differentiable learning. However, the original formulation of LTN is primarily suited to data represented as flat collections of individuals, and does not explicitly capture structural organization such as temporal order, sequential position, or graph connectivity. We introduce sLTN, an extension of LTN that makes structural dimensions first-class elements of the language. Structural dimensions represent named tensor axes associated with domain-specific organization, such as time steps, sequence positions, or graph nodes. They can be quantified explicitly, related through structural relations, and used to express temporal, sequential, and relational constraints directly at the logical level. We formalize the syntax and fuzzy tensor semantics of sLTN and show that, in the absence of structural dimensions, the framework recovers the original LTN semantics as a special case. We further describe a PyTorch implementation based on a declarative signature, formula parsing, and tensorial interpretation. The framework is illustrated on representative temporal and sequential reasoning examples. This paper serves as a companion to the sltn library, available at https://github.com/logictensornetworks/sltn.
