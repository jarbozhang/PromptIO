Precision industrial contact manipulation requires reliable robot policies under pose perturbations and contact-force constraints. Vision-language-action models offer broad generalization but often introduce high inference latency and GPU-memory cost, while vision-action chunking policies are more suitable for real-time industrial control. However, these policies are usually trained by behavior cloning and suffer from distribution shift in contact-rich tasks. This paper proposes PAC-ACT, a reinforcement-learning post-training framework for pretrained Action Chunking Transformer policies. PAC-ACT reformulates policy optimization at the chunk level, constructs an ACT-transferred actor-critic architecture, and introduces a hybrid behavior-prior constraint to preserve the pretrained action distribution during online fine-tuning. Experiments on industrial precision-contact benchmarks show that PAC-ACT improves task success, contact stability, and force safety while retaining low latency and low GPU-memory usage. On the Contour task, PAC-ACT significantly reduces peak contact force and decreases the proportion of force readings above 60 N by 46 times. Sparse-reward ablations further show that the proposed behavior-prior constraint enables effective exploration under randomized initial poses.
