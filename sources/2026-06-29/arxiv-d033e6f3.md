Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have become a leading tool for interpreting the representations of vision foundation models, decomposing their polysemantic activations into a larger set of sparse, more monosemantic features. The Top-$k$ SAE, a now-standard variant, enforces sparsity architecturally through its activation function, retaining only the $k$ most active latents per input. Because it was designed precisely to avoid the $\ell_1$ penalty used by earlier SAEs and its known drawbacks, it has not been combined with an explicit sparsity regularizer, despite retaining limitations of its own, such as a budget $k$ that is fixed regardless of input complexity and a tendency to overfit to the training value of $k$. We introduce two sparsity regularizers compatible with the Top-$k$ architecture, both acting on the activations before the Top-$k$ selection: an $\ell_1$ penalty on the unselected (off-support) units, and a scale-invariant $\ell_1/\ell_2$-ratio penalty that concentrates the code onto fewer effective units. Both penalties are applied only to the batch-active units, those selected by the Top-$k$ operator at least once within the batch. Across two datasets, three vision foundation models, and a range of $k$, both regularizers consistently improve monosemanticity at no cost to reconstruction quality. The $\ell_1/\ell_2$ penalty further concentrates information into fewer latents, making reconstruction more robust to the inference-time choice of $k$ and improving small-budge
