Retrieval-Augmented Generation enhances large language models by incorporating external knowledge, but deploying it in sensitive scenarios risks privacy leakage via malicious prompts. To address this, we propose a multi-agent framework that sanitizes retrieved content through semantic rewriting. By employing three specialized agents for privacy extraction, semantic analysis, and reconstruction, our approach collaboratively removes sensitive identifiers while preserving the semantic core. We evaluate the framework on the ChatDoctor and Wiki-PII datasets across six large language models. Experimental results demonstrate a significant reduction in privacy leakage under targeted attacks. For instance, we reduced targeted information exposure in LLaMA-3-8B from 144 instances in the baseline to just 1. Furthermore, we maintain strong contextual fidelity with a BLEU-1 score of 0.122, outperforming the existing SAGE method's 0.117. Finally, the framework operates as an asynchronous preprocessing module, introducing no additional latency to online inference, as all rewriting is executed as a one-time offline preprocessing step. To promote reproducibility, the source code of this work is publicly available at https://github.com/foursoils/Privacy-Preserving-RAG.
