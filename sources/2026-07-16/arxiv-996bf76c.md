Engineering use of AI forecasting models requires not only high nominal accuracy but also predictable behavior under uncertain inputs. In photovoltaic (PV) forecasting, this requirement is especially challenging because numerical weather prediction (NWP) errors are temporally correlated, state dependent, and physically coupled across variables. Existing evaluations, however, often rely on perfect forecast assumptions or simplistic perturbations that do not reflect these characteristics. This study presents a physically constrained robustness evaluation framework based on simulation, using virtual PV power as a controlled response variable to isolate the propagation of input uncertainty from confounders at the plant level. Six representative machine learning and deep sequence models, including PatchTST, GRU, N-HITS, and LightGBM, are evaluated under dynamic NWP perturbations with heteroscedasticity modulated by clear-sky conditions and Erbs reconstruction that preserves radiation consistency. The results show that sequence models provide stronger noise filtering and temporal resilience than a strong tabular baseline under medium to high disturbance regimes. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Integrated Gradients (IG) further support a feature reallocation tendency at the case level, in which predictive reliance shifts from corrupted future forecasts toward more stable historical observations and deterministic physical priors.
