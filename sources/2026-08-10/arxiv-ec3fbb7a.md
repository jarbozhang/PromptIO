Accurate user equipment (UE) localization is critical for beam management in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted millimeter-wave (mmWave) based sixth-generation (6G) networks, especially if the direct base-station-UE links are unavailable. This paper proposes a beam-domain fingerprint framework that maps the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) across a small set of predefined RIS reflection states to the UE azimuth angle and range, without requiring channel state information (CSI). Crucially, we extend the framework to a realistic interference-impaired scenario in which a nearby cross-link interferer (CLI) corrupts the clean SNR fingerprint, yielding a signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) fingerprint; an interference-to-noise ratio (INR)-constrained calibration strategy keeps the interference level physically interpretable. Four machine-learning (ML) regressors are evaluated under both conditions. Simulation results at 28 GHz with a 20x20 RIS show that k-nearest neighbors (KNN) achieves the lowest angle MAE of 0.37 degrees and range MAE of 4 cm under clean conditions, rising to 1.4 degrees and 7.6 cm under interference. A key finding is that interference degrades angle estimation substantially more than range estimation across all models, a consequence of the asymmetric encoding of location information in the beam-domain fingerprint.
