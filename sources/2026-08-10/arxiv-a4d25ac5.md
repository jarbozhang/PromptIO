Under the standard split, Muon gets hidden matrices and AdamW embeddings/output head. Muon groks modular addition faster, but its solutions do not hold. All nine configurations on $(a+b) \bmod 113$ grok and later lose generalization. Across five seeds the selected AdamW reference falls below threshold on four, reaching 27.59%. Instability persists across two moduli, two widths, two training fractions, subtraction, and depth. The failure arises at the representation-readout interface, identified only jointly up to an invertible map unselected by the loss. After solving the training set, the gradient falls to order $10^{-6}$ and the optimizers respond differently: step-size elasticity is -0.03 for Muon versus +1.5 for AdamW, and the Muon group moves 8.0 times faster per parameter. From bit-identical states, freezing either group prevents failure. Freezing embeddings/readout removes it in five runs over 451,400 post-grokking steps and five paired seeds: unfrozen arms record 137-321 sub-threshold evaluations, frozen arms none. Removing Muon's normalization and orthogonalization is no substitute: it collapses representation from 326 effective conjugate pairs to 4, shows no recurrent collapse, and fails terminally. Fourier filtering separates circuit failure from masking. Across 43 checkpoints over five seeds and three regimes, the task-aligned family reaches exactly 100% alone. In circuit failure it no longer solves the task; in masking it remains perfect while the full model reac
