Fluorescent protein quantum yield (QY) is governed by the mature chromophore and its three-dimensional microenvironment rather than sequence identity alone. Protein language models and emission-band averages capture global trends, but do not model how local physical signals act on specific chromophore regions. We present a chromophore-centred mechanism graph algorithm for QY prediction. Each PDB structure is converted into a typed 3D residue graph, registered to a mature-CRO state, partitioned into phenolate, bridge and imidazolinone regions, and transformed by channel-signal-region propagation. The representation contains 121 enrichment features; after removing identity shortcuts, 52 non-identity features are used for band-specific ExtraTrees regression. Because each feature encodes a contact channel, seed signal and target CRO region, interpretation is intrinsic rather than post hoc. On a 531-protein benchmark, the method achieved the best random-CV performance among model-based baselines (R = 0.772 +/- 0.008, MAE = 0.131 +/- 0.002), exceeding Band mean (R = 0.632), ESM-C (R = 0.734) and SaProt (R = 0.731), and ranked first in bright screening (Bright P@5 = 0.704). Under homology control, the advantage was clearest in the remote bucket (&lt;50% similarity; R = 0.697 versus 0.633, 0.575 and 0.408), with the strongest overall bright/dark Top-K screening. Stable selected features recovered band-specific mechanisms: aromatic packing and clamp asymmetry in GFP-like proteins, cha
