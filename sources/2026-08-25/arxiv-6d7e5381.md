Historical people may appear under different languages, scripts, and transcription traditions, while distinct individuals may share highly similar or even identical names. This makes historical identity reconciliation more than a problem of string matching or transliteration. We introduce MHER, a provenance-controlled benchmark for pairwise reconciliation of person-name attestations from the Mongol world. MHER contains a balanced 396-pair Name-only core over 84 primary historical persons and a stricter 160-pair Source-grounded subset constructed from mention-by-source evidence, with entity-disjoint development and test splits. Across five generative systems, correctly Source-grounded evidence improves paired TEST accuracy by 12.96 to 94.44 percentage points relative to Name-only input. On five identical-surface different-person cases, all models fail under names alone (0/25 model-item decisions), whereas Source-grounded evidence yields 24/25 correct resolutions, with the remaining output an abstention. Context-only ablations show that historical descriptions often carry substantial identity information, while explicitly signaled misgrounding controls produce substantially lower performance. We also find that names are not uniformly beneficial: for Qwen3-8B, restoring surface forms converts ten otherwise correct Context-only distinctions into false identity merges. These results show that historical entity reconciliation depends not only on surface correspondence, but on wheth
