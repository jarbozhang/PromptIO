Deep learning-based medical image segmentation typically relies on ground truth (GT) labels obtained through manual annotation, but these can be prone to random errors or systematic biases. This study examines the robustness of deep learning models to such errors in echocardiography (echo) segmentation and evaluates a novel strategy for detecting and refurbishing erroneous labels during model training. Using the CAMUS dataset, we simulate three error types, then compare a loss-based GT label error detection method with one based on Variance of Gradients (VOG). We also propose a pseudo-labelling approach to refurbish suspected erroneous GT labels. We assess the performance of our proposed approach under varying error levels. Results show that VOG proved highly effective in flagging erroneous GT labels during training. However, a standard U-Net maintained strong performance under random label errors and moderate levels of systematic errors (up to 50%). The detection and refurbishment approach improved performance, particularly under high-error conditions.
