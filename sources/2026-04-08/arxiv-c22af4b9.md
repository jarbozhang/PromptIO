MLLMs have been successfully applied to multimodal embedding tasks, yet their generative reasoning capabilities remain underutilized. Directly incorporating chain-of-thought reasoning into embedding learning introduces two fundamental challenges. First, structural misalignment between instance-level reasoning and pairwise contrastive supervision may lead to shortcut behavior, where the model merely learns the superficial format of reasoning. Second, reasoning is not universally beneficial for embedding tasks. Enforcing reasoning for all inputs may introduce unnecessary computation and latency, and can even obscure salient semantic signals for simple cases. To address these issues, we propose MMEmb-R1, an adaptive reasoning-based multimodal embedding framework. We formulate reasoning as a latent variable and introduce pair-aware reasoning selection that employs counterfactual intervention to identify reasoning paths beneficial for query-target alignment. Furthermore, we adopt reinforcement learning to selectively invoke reasoning only when necessary. Experiments on the MMEB-V2 benchmark demonstrate that our model achieves a score of 71.2 with only 4B parameters, establishing a new state-of-the-art while significantly reducing reasoning overhead and inference latency.
